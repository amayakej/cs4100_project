# cs4100_project
Our team consists of three members, Samin Sattik, Viren Patel & Amaya Kejriwal. 

In terms of splitting up the responsibilities, we believe we would work more efficiently all together. While finalizing the theme and scope of our project, we plan on meeting weekly. We would perhaps split up the tasks once we finalize our goal and assess our own strengths and weaknesses in a
group setting.

The overall problem that we are going to be addressing is creating a Connect 4 game playing
agent that can beat most humans at the game. The model would use some variation of a
Minimax algorithm, and potentially use a machine learning model as an evaluation function. The
input to the algorithm would be a game state, and the output would be an optimal move to play.

The ideal outcome of the project is to create a Connect 4 agent that beats a human playing the
game 100% of the time. We expect to show that there are certain optimal strategies to use when
playing Connect 4.

We expect to use a Minimax algorithm that serves as the core of the game playing agent. We
also expect to train a machine learning model that can accurately evaluate an intermediate state
and assign an accurate value to it.

For creating a machine learning model for the evaluation function, we would of course need to
learn machine learning. We would also specifically need to learn how to create and train a
machine learning model in Python.

Potential Libraries we might use:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn
- Theano
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

We could create our own dataset for the purposes of this project. The idea is that we can create
two Connect 4 agents that play the game at random, then tally the number of times each side
won or lost in each state.
